.. py:class:: NormalizedImageFeatures(imageFeatures: pyslam.image_processing.ImageFeatures)

   This class takes in an ImageFeatures object and normalizes all
   detected keypoints to be suitable for the normalized variation of
   the DLT and eight point algorithm. As such, it normalizes all points
   so that they are zero meaned with the average distance from origin being
   sqrt(2)
