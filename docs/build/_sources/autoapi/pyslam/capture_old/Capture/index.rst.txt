   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   This class represents a "capture" from a Sensor(akin to a single
   sensor measurement for other kinds of sensors). This is an
   abstract base class, with specific types of captures being
   subclassed from here. Subclasses can have extra properties
   specific to that type of capture, such as a depth map
