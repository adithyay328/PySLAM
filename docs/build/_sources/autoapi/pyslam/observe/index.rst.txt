:py:mod:`pyslam.observe`
========================

.. py:module:: pyslam.observe

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module defines some helper utilities for
   working with a pattern that shows up commonly
   in SLAM, which is the Observer pattern;
   to give an example as to why this makes sense,
   suppose you have a pipeline where you

   #. Capture an image from the camera
   #. Extract features from the camera
   #. Fit a model to the features in a stereo pair of cameras
      i.e fit a fundamental/homography matrix
   #. Get motion hypotheses from those models.
   #. Add the new keyframe/pose to our factor graph.

   Note that in this case, step 2 only runs IN RESPONSE to step 1
   completing, and step 3 only runs IN RESPONSE to step 2,
   etc. As such, it seems reasonable to have some
