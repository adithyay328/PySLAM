   Bases: :py:obj:`pyslam.pubsub.Publisher.Publisher`\ [\ :py:obj:`T`\ ], :py:obj:`Generic`\ [\ :py:obj:`T`\ ], :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   An abstract base class representing a source for
   Measurements; this could be a sensor, a ROS topic, a
   pre-recorded set of datapoints from a SLAM dataset, whatever.
   Has a UID that can be referenced by
   measurements, but apart from that is a pretty
   lightweight interface to subclass.

   :param uid: A UID that uniquely identifies this MeasurementSource
