.. py:class:: PangolinScene(width: int, height: int)

   A class representing a Pangolin Window.

   The way this visualiser is to be used,
   since it's the design that makes the
   most sense based on the underlying API,
   is that client code calls the functions
   on this class, which updates internal
   state variables that indicate what's shown
   on screen.

   Whenever the pangolin frame re-draws, it
   will take all the internal assets and
   re-draw them(basicaly blit) onto the screen.
   This allows updates to the scene at every
   frame re-draw.

   :param width: The width of the display, in pixels.
   :param height: The height of the display, in pixels.
