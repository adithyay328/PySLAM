   Bases: :py:obj:`Generic`\ [\ :py:obj:`T`\ ], :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   An abstract base class that can be subclassed
   by any class that wants to act as a publisher.
   Internally uses a multiprocessing Manager,
   which allows resultant MessageQueues to be used
   accross threads easily.

   .. py:method:: subscribe() -> pyslam.pubsub.MessageQueue.MessageQueue[T]

      Constructs and returns a message queue
      that downstream code can listen on for
      new messages. Maintains a weak-refernce
      internally, so as soon as downstream code loses
      the last strong reference it's garbage collected.

      :return: Returns a message queue that downstream code
        can listen on.


   .. py:method:: publish(message: T) -> None

      Iterates over all message queues
      that haven't yet been garbage collected
      and publishes the message
