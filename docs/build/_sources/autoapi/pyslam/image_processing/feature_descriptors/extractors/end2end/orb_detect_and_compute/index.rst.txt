.. py:class:: ORB_Detect_And_Compute(numPoints: int)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.extractors.DescriptorExtractor.DescriptorExtractor`\ [\ :py:obj:`pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.descriptors.ORB.ORB`\ ], :py:obj:`pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.extractors.KeypointExtractor.KeypointExtractor`

   An end-to-end ORB extractor that uses
   opencv's orb.detectAndCompute internally.

   :param numPoints: The number of keypoints to try and find
       and describe. No guarantee this number will actually be
       computed however.

   .. py:method:: __compute(inImg: PIL.Image.Image) -> None

      An internal function that computes and saves keypoints and
      their corresponding descriptors. Since this is an end-to-end
      extractor these are done together, but since the API treats these
      as separate steps, simply return them separately.


   .. py:method:: getKeypoints(inImg: PIL.Image.Image) -> List[pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.Keypoint.Keypoint]

      Computes keypoints for the given image.

      :param inImg: The image to compute Keypoints for.

      :return: Returns a list of Keypoints.


   .. py:method:: getDescriptors(inImg: PIL.Image.Image, inKeypoints: List[pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.Keypoint.Keypoint]) -> List[pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.descriptors.ORB.ORB]

      Returns all descriptors we computed internally.

      :param inImg: The image to compute Descriptors for.
      :param inKeypoints: The list of Keypoints to compute
          descriptors for.

      :return: Returns a list of Descriptors. We expect it to have
          the same size as inKeypoints, with the Nth descriptor
          describing the Nth keypoint.
