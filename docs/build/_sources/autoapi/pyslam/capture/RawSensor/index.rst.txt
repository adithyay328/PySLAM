.. py:class:: RawSensor

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   An abstract class that implements
   the core functions of a raw sensor. Specific
   types of sensors can derive themselves from this.

   .. py:method:: activateSensor()
      :abstractmethod:

      A function that performs any needed sensor
      initialization and prepares the sensor
      for a capture call. As an example, this might
      tell opencv to start capturing video
      from a camera so that when the SensorWrapper
      calls for a capture, it happens as
      fast as the sensor can manage.


   .. py:method:: teardownSensor()
      :abstractmethod:

      The opposite of startCapture; any cleanup that needs
      to be done is done here,
      and this function tells the sensor to stop recording and
      go into a standby state.
      In the context of a camera, this could mean telling opencv
      to stop capturing frames
      and put the camera into an idle state.


   .. py:method:: capture(sensorWrapperUID) -> pyslam.capture.Capture.Capture
      :abstractmethod:

      Returns a Capture object populated with the data
      the sensor collected.
