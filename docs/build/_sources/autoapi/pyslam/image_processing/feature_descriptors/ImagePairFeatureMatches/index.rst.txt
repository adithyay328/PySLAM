.. py:class:: Match(imgOneIdx: int, imgTwoIdx: int)

   A basic type representing a Match found between 2 images.
   One image needs to be determined as image one, and the other
   is image two. This object contains the indices in both images.

   :param imgOneIdx: The index of the matching descriptor in the first
       image.
   :param imgTwoIdx: The index of the matching descriptor in the second
       image.


.. py:class:: ImagePairMatches(imageFeaturesOne: pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.ImageFeatures.ImageFeatures, imageFeaturesTwo: pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.ImageFeatures.ImageFeatures)

   A class that computes matches of Features across two images.
   Uses FLANN from OpenCV internally.

   :param imageFeaturesOne: The ImageFeatures object corresponding
       to the first image.
   :param imageFeaturesTwo: The ImageFeatures object corresponding
       to the second image.

   .. py:method:: computeMatches() -> None

      Runs the internal matching logic to compute matches
      accross images.
