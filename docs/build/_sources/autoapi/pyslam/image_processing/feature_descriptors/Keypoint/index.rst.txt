.. py:class:: Keypoint(coords: numpy.ndarray)

   This class is quite simple; it corresponds to
   a 2D numpy array, which represents a 2D coordinate
   in an opencv matrix(an image).

   If the numpy array has 2 numbers in it, we assume
   the given point to be heterogenous; if 3 numbers
   are in it, we assume it to be homogenous. This
   class has functions to do simple conversion
   to-and-fro heterogenous and homogenous coordinates.

   :param coords: The 2D coordinates of this keypoint,
     either as a homogenous or heterogenous coordinate;
     as such, shape should be either (2,) or (3,)

   .. py:property:: coords
      :type: numpy.ndarray

      Getter for the internal coordinates of this Keypoint,
      without converting to heterogenous or homogenous.

      :return: A copy of the internal numpy array

   .. py:method:: makeHeterogenous() -> None

      Converts the internal representation of the keypoint into heterogenous for storage


   .. py:method:: makeHomogenous() -> None

      Converts the internal representation of the keypoint into homogenous for storage


   .. py:method:: asHeterogenous() -> numpy.ndarray

      Returns a heterogenous representation of the internal coordinates

      :return: Returns the internal point array, converted to heterogenous,
          which means a 2D vector with no scale dimension.


   .. py:method:: asHomogenous() -> numpy.ndarray

      Returns a homogenous representation of the internal coordinates

      :return: Returns the internal point array, converted to homogenous,
          which means a 3D vector with a scale dimension.
