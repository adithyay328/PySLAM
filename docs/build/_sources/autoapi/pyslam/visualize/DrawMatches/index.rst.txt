======================================

.. py:module:: pyslam.visualize.DrawMatches

   their descriptors and a match object between them, and draws
   the matches onto an openvc matrix that we return.

   pyslam.visualize.DrawMatches.drawStereoMatches



.. py:function:: drawStereoMatches(imgOne: PIL.Image.Image, imgTwo: PIL.Image.Image, imgOneFeatures: pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.ImageFeatures.ImageFeatures, imgTwoFeatures: pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.ImageFeatures.ImageFeatures, matches: pyslam.image_processing.feature_descriptors.ImagePairFeatureMatches.ImagePairMatches) -> PIL.Image.Image

   This function uses OpenCV's drawing functionality to
   draw matches between images, and returns the image as
   a Pillow image.

   :param imgOne: The first Image as a Pillow Image.
   :param imgTwo: The first Image as a Pillow Image.
   :param imgOneFeatures: Features from the first image.
   :param imgTwoFeatures: Features from the first image.
   :param matches: Object containing matches we predicted accross both images.

   :return: Returns a Pillow image with the matches drawn onto it.
